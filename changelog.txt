0.3 (20/07/2017) Bug fixes and feature updates
- Increase invite timeout to 60. Either invited or declined (via timeout)
- Remove hack to ignore ratings, instead providing user option
- Space out some of the menu options a bit better
- Fix minimap positon so that it is saved
- Watch players joining/leaving group so we can do certain operations if needed
    Like resetting if leader left, or if we left after group completed
    Or increment required healers/DPS depending on what role left
- Print ratings of joined group. TODO: Need to validate these are reasonable...
